## Test Guidelines

## Coding style check configuration
[checkStyle.xml](./checkStyle.xml) is the HARMAN coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.
Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the `validate` phase and `check` goal of the maven lifecycle and fails the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.


## Tests

If you want to submit a bug fix or new feature, make sure that all tests are passing.

```mvn clean test```
